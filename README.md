# Portfolio
This design is something i made to show off a few of the things I have learned in my classes and self teachings. This is something i work on periodically so there will be updates and changes as i grow. As far as my first go-around i am very proud of my design and cannot wait to see where i can get to from here. Thank you for checking it out and enjoy!
