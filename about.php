          <h2>Growing up in a small town in Alabama has its advantages and disadvantages. We did not have an art class so I had to teach myself to draw. We did not have computer class so I had to teach myself how to use a computer. Once I entered high school I tried out for the yearbook staff and was accepted into designing and implementing my art into the yearbooks we created for our school. Upon graduating I went to college for business administration and soon found myself on the opposite end of the spectrum and enrolling in massage therapy school. Through the years of my massage therapy career I experimented in different mediums with my art craft and got into designing flyers, pyrography, stage performance, wood working, painting, and vulture culture. Finally I came across a web development course and did my research to find myself instantly hooked. With expanding my knowledge into programming languages, I have been able to give my visions their backbones with web design. It has given me so much joy and I plan to extend it even further in the future with more programming languages and possibly game design. <br /><br /><br />Sky is the limit, right? Time to vault into the stratosphere.</h2>
