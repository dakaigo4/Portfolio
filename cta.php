        <h2>Every single day trillions of people log onto the internet. Some mindleslly scrolling and searching for absolutely nothing. All the while there are people who are searching daily for the right service, answer to their question, clothing, shoes--the list goes on. Studies show that everything from the placement all the way down to the color stimulates the mind to influence us to make decisions. Having the proper website for your business can make all of the difference in having customers choose their path on decision making. Having only a social media account limits you to the things you can do to grab the attention of your audience. </h2>
